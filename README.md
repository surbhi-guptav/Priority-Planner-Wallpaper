## 💡 Why I Made This

I love staying organized and making to-do lists, but I got tired of opening apps to add or check tasks—it felt like a chore! 😩 So, I had an idea: what if my tasks were on my desktop wallpaper? That’s how this app was born! It’s your wallpaper, but when you unlock it, it becomes a task planner. While building it, I added AI and automation to make your life even easier. Let’s check it out! 🚀
